# Private Events

Build a site that allows users to create events and then manage user signups.

A user can creates. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like "Andy's house")

The feature is based on the requirements from [The Odin Project's project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events)
